# **Lithium-ion Battery Calendar Ageing Model using Universal Differential Equations**

This repository contains the implementation of a Lithium-ion Battery Calendar Ageing Model, developed using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs). The model is based on the article titled "*Lithium-ion Battery Degradation Modelling using Universal Differential Equations: Development of a Cost-Effective Parameterisation Methodology*" by **Jishnu Ayyangatu Kuzhiyil**, **Theodoros Damoulas**, **Ferran Brosa Planella**, and **W. Dhammika Widanage**.

## **Model Overview**

This repository provides a computational model for simulating the calendar ageing of Lithium-ion batteries. The model includes two approaches:

1. **Physics-Based Model**:  
   A Single Particle Model with Electrolyte (SPMe) forms the base electrochemical model, coupled with additional degradation differential equations to describe Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) growth and associated pore clogging. The degradation is modeled using diffusion-limited and kinetically-limited SEI growth models along with a linear pore clogging model.

2. **UDE-Based Model**:  
   A Single Particle Model with Electrolyte (SPMe) forms the base electrochemical model, coupled with additional degradation differential equations are modeled as Universal Differential Equations, where neural networks are incorporated into the degradation differential equations to capture complex degradation behavior.

## Data Files

The project includes the following data files:

* `RPT_analysis_data.mat`: This file contains the capacity data used for model validation. .

* `RPTx_analysis_data.mat`: This file contains anode Loss of Active Material (LAM) data as used in the referenced article.
  
## **Usage Instructions**

To run the model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JishnuKuzhiyil/Calendar-Ageing-Modelling-using--UDE---Julia-Code.git
   cd Calendar-Ageing-Modelling-using--UDE---Julia-Code

2. **Install the required Julia packages**:
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.activate(".")
   Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

3. **Open the `Main.jl` file in your Julia environment**.

4. **Modify the following variables to simulate different calendar ageing scenarios:
   - `SOC`: Set the State of Charge (e.g., `SOC = 50` for 50% charge)
   - `Temperature`: Set the ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (e.g., `Temperature = 25`)

5. **Choose the model type by setting the `Model` variable**:
   - For the physics-based model: `Model = "Physics"`
   - For the UDE model: `Model = "UDE"`

6. **Run the `Main.jl` script**:
   ```
   julia Main.jl
   ```

## Python reproduction

A Python reproduction of the Julia workflow is included in `python_reproduction.py`. It reproduces:
- loading `RPT_analysis_data.mat` and `RPTx_analysis_data.mat`,
- experiment step construction from RPT dates,
- temperature/model parameter selection (`Physics`/`UDE`),
- quick visualization of capacity and LAM measurements.

### Run in Python

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-python.txt
python python_reproduction.py
```

This writes `python_reproduction_preview.png` in the repository root.
